;;; Commentary:

;; This will cause comint buffers to always display the maximum amount
;; of output by keeping the prompt at the bottom of the respective
;; window. The code is taken from ERC, and adapted to comint-mode.

;; To use, just add the following to your .emacs:

;; (add-hook 'comint-mode-hook 'comint-add-scroll-to-bottom)

;;; Code:

(defun comint-add-scroll-to-bottom ()
  "Activate `comint-scroll-to-bottom'.
This should be put in `comint-mode-hook' or any derived mode."
  (add-hook 'window-scroll-functions 'comint-scroll-to-bottom nil t))

(defun comint-scroll-to-bottom (window display-start)
  "Recenter WINDOW so that point is on the last line.

This is added to `window-scroll-functions' by
`comint-add-scroll-to-bottom'.

The code is shamelessly taken (but adapted) from ERC."
  (let ((proc (get-buffer-process (current-buffer))))
    (when (and proc
               window
               (window-live-p window))
      (let ((resize-mini-windows nil))
        (save-selected-window
          (select-window window)
          (save-restriction
            (widen)
            (when (>= (point) (process-mark proc))
              (save-excursion
                (goto-char (point-max))
                (recenter -1)
                (sit-for 0)))))))))
